this tiny chip-8 interpreter (binary being 53 KB!) should handle everything you throw at it from test roms , to games and any other binaries/ROMs/whatever-you-call-it, that satisfies you.

## running ROMs
to run a ROM, you just run the interpreter's binary in the command line, followed by the path to a valid chip-8 ROM

```bash
./path/to/bit8/executable /path/to/rom
```
that's it! easy-peasy, lemon squeezy! üçã

## building source
building the interpreter is just as straightforward as running it itself, since it requires only one framework. you can compile it with your compiler of choice, of course, but i build it with `clang` and i do it like so:
```bash
clang -o /path/to/output -lSDL2 main.c
```
that's about it!

## contributions
